    notes:
      curvature_undulation_coupling_notes: |
        Note that we have to check the following features of this calculation:
          1. are curvature fields wrapping over PBCs?
          2. is the average field a faithful depiction of the field i.e. what do instantaneous fields look like when the protein is on either side? and why is the top part of the box completely zeroed out even though the bottom part has some intensity at the edge? it is likely that the reference grid is not wrapping.
